        m_Untranslated: Post Processing
      Text:
        m_Untranslated: "Post processing is a rendering technique that allows designers
          to change the look and feel of their scene by using effects that are applied
          to the final rendered image of the game (with added information about the
          depth of scene), rather than by applying effects to specific objects in
          the scene.\r\nDesigners are able to easily add effects which make a scene
          seem colder or darker, or conversely brighter and happier. Effects such
          as motion blur, or neon glow can also be applied. These effects\u2014when
          used with some thought\u2014can apply a level of polish to a game, and
          help evoke emotions in players.\r\nIn the past, these effects were added
          by adding scripts to the camera in the game for each effect. Unity 2017
          added the concept of the \u201CPost Processing Stack\u201D. Like Cinemachine
          it has graduated to be a fully-fledged Unity Package.\r"
