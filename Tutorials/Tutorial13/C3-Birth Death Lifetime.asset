      Text:
        m_Untranslated: "When a particle is created, it obtains some initial \u201Cstart\u201D
          settings. Many of these are set in the first group of options for the particle
          system, such as the size, rotation, speed (velocity), and colour. \r\nThe
          particle then stays around for a given lifetime value, and many of the
          sub-sections of the particle system object adjust how various properties
          such as movement (speed, and applied force), colour, rotation, and size
          change over the course of this lifetime. Using this, you can make a wide
          range of effects such as particles becoming smaller before they die, increasing
          in alpha (transparency) over time, or even applying a downwards force to
          simulate gravity.\r\nThese variables can also be adjusted based upon the
          speed of a particle. Since you can randomize the speed of particles, and
          speed can also be effected by forces and collisions, it may be more useful
          to define changes in terms of speed rather than time (for example a particle
          that glows red hot once it reaches a certain velocity).\r"
