        m_Untranslated: Trail Renderer Settings
      Text:
        m_Untranslated: "Let\u2019s have a look at some of the settings we can apply
          to the trail renderer:\r\n\u2022 The <b>width</b> of the trail can be set
          for the entire length of the trail, as well as how the width should vary
          between the start and end of the trail;\r\n\u2022 The <b>time</b> setting
          adjusts how long a trail should last for, in terms of how long since a
          segment of the trail was created should it be visible for;\r\n\u2022 The
          <b>min vertex distance</b> required before a new trail segment should be created
          allows us to adjust the smoothness/quality of the trail;\r\n\u2022 The
          <b>colour</b> of the trail can be set as a gradient over the length of
          the trail;\r\n\u2022 The <b>corner</b> and <b>end cap vertices</b> settings
          allow you to add rounding to sharp edges of the trail;\r\n\u2022 The <b>alignment</b>
          setting determines what direction the trail should point (toward the camera
          view, or work out a rotation based upon the object\u2019s movement in 3D);
          \r\n\u2022 If your material uses a texture, <b>texture mode</b> determines
          how should that texture be distributed across the length of the trail (stretched,
          tiled based upon distance, tiled based upon segment size, etc);\r\n\u2022
          As the Trail Renderer works in 3D, options for the lighting system are
          provided, currently generate lighting data is off, but there are also settings
          for <b>shadows, lighting, and probes for lights and reflections</b> (we
          won\u2019t use any of these);\r\n\u2022 The <b>material</b> of the renderer
          allows us to use custom shaders for various effects; and\r\n\u2022 Additional
          settings for <b>motion vectors</b> (for motion blurring), <b>occlusion</b>,
          and for where the trail is placed in the 2D <b>sorting layers</b> (which
          we\u2019ve already used).\r"
