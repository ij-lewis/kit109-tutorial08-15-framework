        m_Untranslated: "Let\u2019s improve the line that is drawn from the player
          to the mouse by using some of the information that is provided in the RaycastHit2D
          array. For a start, we know how many objects have been hit by checking
          the length of the array by accessing hitObjects.Length. For any of the
          items in the array, we can access the following information:\r\n\u2022
          The point in world space where it was hit: <c>hit.point</c>\r\n\u2022 The
          normal of the surface that was hit: <c>hit.normal</c>\r\n\u2022 The collider
          that was hit: <c>hit.collider</c>\r"

        m_Untranslated: Coding Challenge
      Text:
        m_Untranslated: Using some of this information, write some code that checks
          if there is a collider between the player and the mouse, and if so draws
          a line to that hit point, instead of to the mouse position (if there was
          no hit, then just draw the line to the mouse location). The code to do
          this is provided on the next page if you get stuck, but try to code this
          yourself first.
