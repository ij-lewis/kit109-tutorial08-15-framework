      Text:
        m_Untranslated: "<b>This page is really just here for info, and only just
          palettable for computer-science students. If maths, binary, or computers
          in general are not your thing, feel free to skip the information on this
          page.</b>\nThe <doc>LayerMask</doc> class is a recent addition to Unity
          to make filtering layers easier to do in code. <i>Back in my day</i> we
          used to have to use <b>bit-wise</b> operations in C# to represent a mask
          of layers to use. \nHere's how they work (you can test this out for yourself
          if you like):\nThe following code does exactly the same thing as the code
          we just wrote:\n<code>\nint layerMask = 1 &lt;&lt; 11;\r\nCollider2D[]
          collidersUnderMouse = Physics2D.OverlapPointAll(mousePositionInWorldSpace,
          layerMask);\r\n</code>\nThis uses the <b>bitwise left-shift operator</b>,
          which you may not have seen before. Recalling how numbers are stored in
          binary, the left-shift operator shifts all bits in the preceding value
          to the left, removing any that overflow off the left, and adding a 0 bit
          on the right. This is done however multiple times, defined by the number
          after the operator. So in our example we take the number 1 in binary (shown
          here with only 16 bits, instead of 32):\r\n<code>\n0000 0000 0000 0001
          = 1\r\n</code>\nand shift the bits to the left 11 times, resulting in the
          number:\r\n<code>\n0000 1000 0000 0000 = 2048\n</code>\r\nBut why are we
          doing this operation? What is special about the number 11? First, have
          a look at one of the enemies in the scene. Click on the layer drop down,
          and notice that the Enemies layer is layer number 11.\r\nSo why not just
          send the number 11 as the layer mask? Because then it wouldn\u2019t be
          possible to filter multiple layers within the same function call to <c>OverlapPoint</c>
          etc. Instead we use a bitmask, as it is extremely performant for filtering
          out values. In a layer bit mask, each layer corresponds to a certain bit
          in the layer mask value. If that bit is a 1, it is included in the mask.
          If that bit is a 0 it is excluded. Super-fast bit-wise AND operations are
          performed by the physics system on this mask to determine if found colliders
          should be included in the results or not:\r"
