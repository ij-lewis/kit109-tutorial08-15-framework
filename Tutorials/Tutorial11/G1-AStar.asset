      Title:
        m_Untranslated: Pathfinding With A* (A-Star)
      Text:
        m_Untranslated: "(The code in this section is based upon work done by the
          Unity community, found here: <a>http://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php/AStarHelper</a>)\r\nThe
          behaviours we have seen so far have only focused on a particular target,
          and ignore the environment. A better AI would take into account the walls,
          and be able to walk around them, instead of into them.\r\nTo accomplish
          this, we need to implement pathfinding. This is a very broad topic, and
          there are lots of different approaches and algorithms that can be used.
          Unity provides a feature-rich implementation called NavMash, however this
          is limited to 3D games. While there are assets out there that provide this
          functionality, a simple and effective approach is to use the well-established
          A* (A-Star) algorithm.\r\nFirst developed at Stanford in 1986, A* uses
          a weighted-graph of nodes. Each node defines links to other nodes, as well
          as the cost associated with each link. The algorithm examines all paths
          through these nodes for the best possible path in terms of cost (e.g. shortest
          distance, but you can factor in other costs based upon the problem at hand,
          such as tollways, hills, different surfaces etc.) \r\nThe specifics of
          A* are beyond the scope of this unit (we will instead be looking at how
          an AI could use A* to track a target), but the following two resources
          are an excellent guide to what\u2019s \u201Cunder the hood\u201D of the
          A* search:\r\nIntroduction to A*: <a>https://www.raywenderlich.com/4946/introduction-to-a-pathfinding
