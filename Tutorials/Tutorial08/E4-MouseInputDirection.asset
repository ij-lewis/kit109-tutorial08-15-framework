      Text:
        m_Untranslated: 'If you test the game now, you''ll see that the shooting
          animation is triggered when we press the mouse button. However:

          -
          no bullets come out (that is for later); and

          - the player doesn''t
          shoot in the direction of the mouse (it shoots in the direction the player is moving or idling, because
          this character can''t move and shoot).

          To fix this, the <asset>PlayerShooting</asset>
          script needs to set the <c>XSpeed</c> and <c>YSpeed</c> values to the direction
          of the mouse. We''re about to get into Vector Maths territory here, but
          don''t worry if this doesn''t make sense to you. Vector Maths is fairly
          common in many types of games programming though, so you may want to brush
          up on it.'

          but doesn't actually fix the problem. On to the next step!
