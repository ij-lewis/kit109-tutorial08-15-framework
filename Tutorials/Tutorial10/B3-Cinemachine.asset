      Text:
        m_Untranslated: "A much more powerful way of following the player and accomplishing
          other amazing dynamic camera movement is through a tool called Cinemachine.\r\nCinemachine
          was originally developed by Adam Myhill, who is now the Head of Cinematics
          at Unity. The tool was acquired by Unity and is now considered part of
          the core product. Previously, it was available as third-party asset on
          the Asset Store, then an official asset on the Asset Store, and is now
          part of the Unity Package Manager. \nWe will learn about Package Manager
          as a seperate guide on MyLO. For now, just know that Cinemachine has already
          been imported into this project."
