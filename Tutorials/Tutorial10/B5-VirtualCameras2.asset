        m_Untranslated: As expected, this creates a new 2D camera in the game world.
          However, upon further inspection of the virtual camera, you will see that
          it does not use the traditional Camera component. Instead it is using the
          Cinemachine Virtual Camera component.

      Text:
        m_Untranslated: "Cinemachine assigns your main camera to one of many virtual
          cameras in the scene (and, as we will see, sometimes a combination of more
          than one). There are plenty of moving parts on the Virtual Camera component,
          and we will try a number of these throughout the practical (you are encouraged
          to play around with these settings to understand their effect\u2014once
          you\u2019ve learnt the basics):\r\n\u2022 The Status of the camera (is
          it currently being shown), plus a \u201CSolo\u201D button to force the
          editor to only use this camera temporarily.\r\n\u2022 Toggling the Game
          Window Guides which are an editor screen overlay which we will cover in
          detail shortly.\r\n\u2022 Whether or not to Save During Play\u2014you may
          find yourself fine-tuning or tweaking Cinemachine shots, which is easier
          to do during play mode. Recall that scene changes don\u2019t save during
          Play Mode, and this option allows us to override this behavior.\r\n\u2022
          The Priority of the camera\u2014used to determine which camera to show
          if multiple cameras meet the criteria for being shown.\r\n\u2022 What game
          objects to Follow and/or Look At (the former will move the camera with
          the target, the latter will point the camera at the target)\r\n\u2022 The
          camera Lens settings for zoom and clipping.\r\n\u2022 Additional settings
          for how the camera should move (i.e. how should its Body behave, used in
          conjunction with the Follow target\u2014the specific settings in here will
          be described in detail later in the practical).\r\n\u2022 Additional settings
          for how the camera should aim (used in conjunction with the Look At target).\r\n\u2022
          Additional settings for any additional \u201Cnoise\u201D movement on the
          camera (think handheld camera movement, used to make shots look more natural
          and dynamic).\r\n"
